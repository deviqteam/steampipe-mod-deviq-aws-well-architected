  description = "When a service is unable to respond successfully to a request, fail fast. This allows resources associated with a request to be released, and permits a service to recover if itâ€™s running out of resources. Failing fast is a well-established software design pattern that can be leveraged to build highly reliable workloads in the cloud. Queuing is also a well-established enterprise integration pattern that can smooth load and allow clients to release resources when asynchronous processing can be tolerated. When a service is able to respond successfully under normal conditions but fails when the rate of requests is too high, use a queue to buffer requests. However, do not allow a buildup of long queue backlogs that can result in processing stale requests that a client has already given up on."

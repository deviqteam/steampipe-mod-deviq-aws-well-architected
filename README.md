# AWS Well-Architected Mod for Powerpipe

## NOTE

    Uses the AWS Well Architected 2024 July Specification.

    This is work in progress, as benchmarks, mods and any additional changes are required to realign the checks to the latest spec.

    Placeholders have been added to best practices that have not been mapped yet, have no mods or tooling available yet or simple cannot be
    inferred from the workload.

    Still deciding what actions make sense for the non-automatable checks.

200+ checks covering AWS Well-Architected Framework defined best practices across all AWS regions.

Run checks in a dashboard:

Or in a terminal:

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default AWS credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) or [customize AWS credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-well-architected
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.

### Running Checks in Your Terminal

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run well_architected_framework
```

Run a benchmark for a specific pillar:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run well_architected_framework_security
```

Run a benchmark for a specific question:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run well_architected_framework_sec01
```

Run a benchmark for a specific best practice:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run well_architected_framework_sec01_bp01
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).

### Common and Tag Dimensions

The benchmark queries use common properties (like `account_id`, `connection_name` and `region`) and tags that are defined in the dependent [AWS Compliance mod](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance) These properties can be executed in the following ways:

It's easiest to setup your vars file, starting with the sample:

```sh
cp powerpipe.ppvars.example powerpipe.ppvars
vi powerpipe.ppvars
```

Alternatively you can pass variables on the command line:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run well_architected_framework_security --var 'common_dimensions=["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]'
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export PP_VAR_common_dimensions='["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]'
export PP_VAR_tag_dimensions='["Environment", "Owner"]'
powerpipe benchmark run well_architected_framework_security
```
